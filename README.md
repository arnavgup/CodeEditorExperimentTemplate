# CodeEditorExperimentTemplate
For running and logging code experiments in the browser

Created using Node.js and Express (this will make it easier to store log data on the server side).

To run:
1. Download repo
2. Make sure you have Node.js installed, cd into the repo's directory and run npm install
3. Run npm start
4. Go to http://localhost:3000/

Note that every time you make a change in the app you will have to kill and restart the app (unless you use special debug commands which you are free to look up).

Happy coding!
